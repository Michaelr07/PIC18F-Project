# PIC18F-Project

Climate Control System: You created a real-time system that adjusts the environment based on temperature readings. This involved using temperature sensors to monitor conditions and a fan to make automated adjustments.
Alarm System: You integrated a real-time clock (RTC) with an interrupt-driven alarm system. This system likely triggers an alert based on the time or specific events, and it uses a speaker to deliver notifications.
User Interface: Both systems can be managed via an IR remote control, which suggests you implemented IR communication to handle user inputs.
Display: The status and controls for both systems are shown on a TFT LCD, allowing for a clear and interactive user interface.
Development Tools: You used MPLAB X IDE for development, C programming for coding, and handled interrupts to manage real-time operations efficiently.
